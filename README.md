# Deep-Learning-Projects
Face Mask Detection Using CNN

### Aim Of This Project
The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning-based system that can automatically detect whether individuals are wearing face masks or not, by analyzing facial images in real-time, thereby promoting public health safety and supporting preventive measures in public spaces.


By implementing this project,  aim to contribute towards safer environments and showcase how AI technologies can support global health initiatives.
